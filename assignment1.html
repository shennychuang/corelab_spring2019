        <p>The first time my brother says ain't my mother<br>
        pulls a branch from the willow tree growing down<br>
        the hill at the edge<br>
        of our backyard.<br>
        As she slips her closed hand over it,<br>
        removes the leaves,<br>
        my brother begins to cry<br>
        because the branch is a switch now<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          no longer beautifully weeping at the bottom of the hill.<br>
          It whirs as my mother whips it<br>
through the air and down<br>
against my brother's legs.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          You will never, my mother says,<br>
say ain't in this house.<br>
You will never<br>
say ain't anywhere.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each switching is a warning to us<br>
our words are to remain<br>
crisp and clear.<br>
We are never to say huh?<br>
ain't or y'all<br>
git or gonna.<br>
Never ma'am just yes, with eyes<br>
meeting eyes enough<br>
to show respect.<br>
Don't ever ma'am anyone!<br>
The word too painful<br>
a memory for my mother<br>
of not-so-long-ago<br>
southern subservient days . . .<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of what not to say<br>
goes on and on . . .<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          You are from the North, our mother says.<br>
You know the right way to speak.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the switch raises dark welts on my brother's legs<br>
Dell and I look on<br>
afraid to open our mouths. Fearing the South<br>
will slip out or<br>
into them.<br><br>
